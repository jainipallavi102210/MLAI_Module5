### Coupon Acceptance Prediction

Welcome to the Coupon Acceptance Prediction project! This repository serves as a practical application for the MLAI (Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence) course, where we apply our learnings in exploratory data analysis, plotting, statistical summarization, and data visualization techniques to a machine learning problem.

### Dataset Overview

The dataset used in this project is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and was collected through a survey conducted on Amazon Mechanical Turk. The survey presents various driving scenarios, capturing information such as the destination, current time, weather conditions, passenger details, and more. Participants were asked to indicate whether they would accept a coupon if they were the driver in each scenario. 

### Project Goals

The primary goal of this project is to predict whether a driver will accept a coupon based on the provided information. By leveraging the dataset's features, we aim to gain insights into the factors influencing coupon acceptance and explore the potential for personalized coupon recommendations.

### Repository Structure

This repository consists of the following files:

README.md: Provides an overview of the project and repository.
data/coupons.csv: The raw dataset file containing the survey responses.
couponacceptance.ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook that focuses on data preprocessing, cleaning and explores the dataset through descriptive statistics, visualizations, and correlation analysis.

### Getting Started

To get started with this project, you can clone the repository and access the Jupyter Notebooks for each stage of the project.
